## Getting Started

You can run your own instance of Whereami. Here’s how:

### Pre-requisites

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.x or later)
  * [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
  * [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) or a compatible database.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whereami-dev/whereami.git
cd whereami
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages listed in `package.json`, including Express, Socket.IO, and the MySQL2 driver.

### 3. Set Up Your Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. This file will store your secret keys and database credentials. The server requires the following variables:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=8888

# Database Connection (MySQL)
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=whereami

# Session Secret
SESSION_SECRET=a_very_strong_secret_key_for_sessions

# Google Maps API Key
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_Maps_api_key_here
```

**Important**: You need a Google Maps API key with the Street View Static API, Geocoding API, and Maps JavaScript API enabled.

### 4. Set Up the Database

You need to create the necessary tables in your MySQL database. Connect to your database and run SQL statements in `plugin/create_database.sql` to create the required tables.

### 5. Run the Server

For development with automatic restarting:

```bash
npm run dev
```

For production:

```bash
npm start
```

Open <http://localhost:8888> (or your specified port) in your browser to start playing!
